# MentalHealthApp
To create a mental health and psychosocial support App

First we'll have a logo page on startup that goes and if details arent collected yet it collects details through the details page(name, age, close person contact), otherwise it links to our main menu page.

MAIN MENU PAGE

First we will have a main menu with an option to edit details, and an "i" button that expands on the app contents and reasons behind each feature

Features(Order not finalized):

1)"LETS KEEP TRACK OF HOW WE FEEL"- leads to mood meter, and a graph, if mood meter is 2, it asks you to call your close one(call button) or send an sms asking to call(sms button, with predefined text that they can edit if they want), if mood meter is 1, it calls suicide helpline, if mood meter is 2 or 3 for a week, it reccomends that you seek help and redirects to help resouces[lets keep this as the first button cuz psychologically its most important]

2)"GOALS"-Leads to a list of 10 checkable goals, each having a time selection view next to them, and button below each list item called "Expand plan for this goal" allowing the user to create a sub list with its own timings to expand on that particular goal. we need to send notifications at all the timings

3)"POSITIVITY DIARY"- Has a short message asking the user to note down atleast three positive thoughts, or experiences a day,before going to bed and has one already pre written called "I am here today" or something like that

4)"HEALTH"- has three sections, "YOGA AND MEDITATION", which leads to a page with links of three sections(yoga,meditation and breathing excersises),and also has a button that redirects to music. The second button is "HYDRATION" which ,keeps trck of how much water a person consumed every day and tells them how much more they need to drink. The third button is "SLEEP" where you can set a reminder for your sleep time where we will send a notification and also be reminded to fill in your mood meter rating and write things in your positivity diary 5 nmins before heading to bed.

5)"HELP RESOURCES"- this button provides you with a button that calls suicide hotline, a button to call your close one, links to places where one can find a therapist online, a heading called "support groups you might like", and under that there is a button called "take quiz".after they take the quiz we display "thank you for takingthe quiz" under the "take quiz" button of the prev page and under that we print the links for the reccomended support groups. these links hve to stay there unless the person clicks "take quiz" again. (if possible we can try to change the button to "retake quiz" after they took it one time but im not sure of exctly how to do that).

6)"MOTIVATION"- this button has inpirational quotes, and links to motivational stories of people who went through hardship etc, we can also add links to motivational pages from instagram, and links to certain youtube channels

7)"SPIRITUAL CORNER"- asks you to select religion from given list, and displays religious content and links based on that. in the list theres an option called "other". if they click that we'll apologigiza and redirect them to "MOTIVATION".

8)"TAP AND PLAY"- this is leads to a series of buttons on the screen called "musical notes " that all play different notes when tapped. below this is another series of buttons called "ASMR" that plays asmr sounds for a relaxing effect, and below that is a third series of buttons called "SURPRISE SUPRISE" (or something) that plays random sounds like kittens puppies baloon deflating etc(idk maybe we can put the baby animals pics on the buttons or something, but i just realized baby animals are soothing to look at and we shud prolly use them somewhere haha)

9)"MUSIC"-this has a list of pre loaded soothing songs that we just play when clicked.(maybe we can also add links to youtube ahaha ok jk too many links kjhfijdfvijh ok well figure that out later lol)
